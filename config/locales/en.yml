# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  about: >
            BlueSource is an employee information tracking system.
            Its creation came from the need to have a universal and
            collaborative tool for storing employee records. By using
            BlueSource, a user is able to maintain information about
            employees, projects, and time off. All data is stored on
            a central database allowing employees to be transferred
            between projects and functional teams securely and efficiently.
            BlueSource uses your current Orasi user credentials, so
            information can be accessed securely without the need for
            creating a separate account.
