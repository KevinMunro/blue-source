<h4>About</h4>
<p>BlueSource is a employee information tracker. It's creation came from the need to have a universal tool for storing employee records. Using BlueSource, a user is able to track general employee information, projects, and time off. All this is stored on a central database so as employees transfer to different functional and project teams, their pertinent information transfers easily. It uses the current Orasi user credentials, so there is no need to create a different account.</p>

Clicking the user's name in the upper right part of the screen or the logo will always return a user to this table.</p>

A pop-up shows with all the available fields for adding an employee. Once finished, click 'Save Employee' to create record or 'Close' to close the pop-up without saving.  Note here that once an employee is added, it cannot be deleted. Instead, projects can move to an 'Inactive' status.

The time remaining for vacations is calculated by the employee's start date. If the employee's start date is missing, this field will default to 10. To view a detailed list or update time off, click the 'Manage' button in bar and the time off details page will show for that employee. From this screen, a user can view running totals and a line-by-line account for all time off submissions.  To add a time off submission, look at the bottom of the table for pre-started new record row. Fill in the 'Date Requested' if different from the current date. Enter the full range for the employee's request. BlueSource will automatically calculate around weekends and holidays so there is no reason to separate each request. Select the type of time off being requested and whether to subtract half from the range selected. Click 'Save Time Off' to submit new record.
